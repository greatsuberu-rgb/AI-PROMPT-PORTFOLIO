📄 Prompt 13a: Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

🎯 Objective

To provide a detailed description of the system’s functional requirements.
An FRD ensures the development team clearly understands what needs to be built, how the system should behave, and how it aligns with business needs.

📝 Prompt Text

You are a Business Analyst. Create a Functional Requirements Document (FRD) for the proposed project.
Include the following sections:

1. Project Overview – background and purpose.


2. System Objectives – intended system goals.


3. Functional Requirements – detailed system features, inputs, outputs, and interactions.


4. Use Cases / User Stories – scenarios describing user interactions.


5. Process Flows / Diagrams – workflows or system logic representation.


6. Data Requirements – data inputs, storage, processing, and reporting.


7. Interface Requirements – integrations with other systems.


8. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) – performance, scalability, usability, compliance.


9. Assumptions & Constraints – system limitations or dependencies.


10. Acceptance Criteria – measurable conditions for system validation.


11. Traceability Matrix – link between FRD and BRD requirements.


12. Approval Signatures – authorization from key stakeholders.



Additionally, provide:

A Narrative Summary explaining why clear functional documentation is critical for project success.

📤 Sample Output

📑 Functional Requirements Document

Project Overview:
The company aims to launch an online food ordering system that simplifies the customer journey, from browsing menus to payment and delivery tracking.

System Objectives:

1. Enable customers to order food online seamlessly.

2. Integrate payment gateways and delivery partner systems.

3. Provide real-time order status updates.


Functional Requirements:

1. Customers can create accounts and log in.


2. System must display restaurant menus with prices and availability.


3. Customers can place, modify, and cancel orders.


4. Payment integration with credit/debit cards and digital wallets.


5. System must notify delivery partners in real time.


6. Customers receive email/SMS updates on order status.



Use Cases / User Stories:

1. As a customer, I want to browse menus by cuisine so that I can quickly find preferred meals.

2. As a customer, I want to receive order updates via SMS so that I can track my delivery.


Process Flows / Diagrams:

Order placement workflow (browse → select items → checkout → payment → confirmation).


Data Requirements:

1. Customer profile data (name, address, preferences).

2. Order data (menu items, prices, delivery time).

3. Payment transaction data.


Interface Requirements:

1. Integration with payment gateway API.

2. Integration with third-party delivery tracking systems.


Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):

1. System uptime: 99.9%.


2. Transactions processed in under 3 seconds.


3. Secure handling of customer payment details (PCI-DSS compliant).



Assumptions & Constraints:

Stable internet connection required.

Delivery partner APIs available 24/7.


Acceptance Criteria:

System successfully processes 95% of transactions without error.

Order status updates are received within 30 seconds of change.

System passes load testing for 10,000 concurrent users.


Traceability Matrix:

BRD Objective: “Seamless online ordering” → FRD Functionality: “End-to-end order placement workflow.”

BRD Requirement: “Real-time delivery tracking” → FRD Requirement: “API integration with delivery partner.”


Approval Signatures:

Product Owner: John Doe

Technical Lead: Jane Smith

Project Manager: Michael Brown

2️⃣ Narrative Explanation

A Functional Requirements Document (FRD) is critical because:

It translates business needs (BRD) into precise system behaviors.

Provides a blueprint for developers, testers, and QA teams.

Reduces risks of misinterpretation, rework, and scope creep.

Enables traceability between business and technical requirements.


Without an FRD, projects risk delivering systems that do not meet business needs or fail user expectations.


---

🔧 Customization Notes

Can include mockups or wireframes to support requirements.

May link each functional requirement to test cases.

Can expand NFRs for scalability, availability, and security.

Diagrams (UML, BPMN) may be included for complex workflows.

💡 Recommended LLM

GPT-4o / GPT-4 Turbo → Best for structured, detailed FRD creation.

Claude 3 Opus → Clear for stakeholder-readable functional requirements.

Gemini Pro → Strong at generating traceability matrices and structured diagrams.

Mistral Large → Ideal for rapid drafts and iterative refinement of FRDs.

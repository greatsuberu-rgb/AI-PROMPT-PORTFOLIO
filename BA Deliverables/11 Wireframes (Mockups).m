### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Narrative Explanation  

Wireframes serve as a **bridge between requirements and design**:  
- They enable **stakeholders to visualize** functionality before development.  
- They reduce ambiguity by illustrating **user journeys** and **screen flows**.  
- They allow early feedback on **usability, accessibility, and navigation**.  
- They provide a foundation for **UI/UX designers and developers** to create high-fidelity prototypes.  

By using wireframes, business analysts ensure that **functionality, not aesthetics**, is the primary focus in the early design phase.

### üîß Customization Notes  
- Wireframes can be **low-fidelity (sketches/textual)** or **high-fidelity (detailed mockups with colors & branding)**.  
- Tools such as **Balsamiq, Figma, Axure, Lucidchart, or Miro** can replace text-based mockups.  
- Add **annotations for accessibility (WCAG standards), responsive behavior (mobile vs desktop), and error handling**.  
- Can be extended to **storyboards or prototypes** for user testing.

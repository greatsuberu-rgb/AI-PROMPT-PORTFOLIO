## 📥 Sample Input  

**Project:** Online Food Ordering System  

**Context:** Customers place orders online, pay digitally, and track delivery status; system integrates with restaurant backend and payment gateways.  

---

## 📤 Sample Output  

### 📑 Functional Specification Document  

**Project Overview:**  
The online food ordering system will streamline customer orders from browsing to payment, integrating with restaurant and delivery systems while providing a seamless UX.  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. Customer account creation and authentication.  
2. Browse menus, filter by cuisine, price, or dietary preference.  
3. Order creation, modification, and cancellation.  
4. Payment processing via card and digital wallets.  
5. Real-time order status notifications.  

**System Architecture Overview:**  
- Web frontend (React.js)  
- Mobile app (iOS/Android, Flutter)  
- Backend API (Node.js) connected to database (PostgreSQL)  
- Payment gateway integration (Stripe API)  
- Delivery partner API integration  

**User Interfaces & Navigation:**  
- Homepage → Menu page → Item selection → Checkout → Payment → Confirmation  
- Responsive design for web and mobile  

**Data Models & Schemas:**  
- **Customer Table:** CustomerID, Name, Email, Phone, Address  
- **Order Table:** OrderID, CustomerID, Items, TotalAmount, Status, Timestamp  
- **Payment Table:** PaymentID, OrderID, Amount, PaymentMethod, Status  

**Business Rules & Logic:**  
- Maximum order per customer: 10 items.  
- Free delivery for orders above £50.  
- Promotions applied based on active coupon codes.  

**Use Cases / User Stories:**  
- *As a customer, I want to pay securely online so that my order is confirmed instantly.*  
- *As a delivery partner, I want real-time order updates so that I can optimize delivery routes.*  

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):**  
1. 99.9% uptime for web and mobile services.  
2. Transactions processed in under 3 seconds.  
3. GDPR-compliant handling of user data.  

**Assumptions & Constraints:**  
- Restaurant APIs will provide accurate inventory data.  
- Payment gateway available 24/7.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- All functional modules pass unit and integration testing.  
- End-to-end order flow tested successfully.  
- Load testing supports 10,000 concurrent users.  

**Traceability Matrix:**  
- FRD Requirement “Order Placement” → FSD Spec “Order creation, modification, cancellation module with API calls”  
- FRD Requirement “Payment Integration” → FSD Spec “Stripe API module with transaction validation”  

**Approval Signatures:**  
- Product Owner: John Doe  
- Technical Lead: Jane Smith  
- Project Manager: Michael Brown

## 2️⃣ Narrative Explanation  

An **FSD** is critical because:  
- Provides **developers and testers a clear blueprint** for implementation.  
- Reduces risk of **misalignment between functional requirements and system design**.  
- Enables **structured traceability** between FRD requirements and developed features.  
- Supports **quality assurance, audits, and compliance verification**.  

---

## 🔧 Customization Notes  
- Can include **priority ranking** for each functional requirement.  
- Use visual **UML diagrams or wireframes** for clarity on UI and navigation.  
- Link business rules to **validation scripts and test cases**.  
- Expand NFRs to cover **performance benchmarks, scalability, and security standards**.

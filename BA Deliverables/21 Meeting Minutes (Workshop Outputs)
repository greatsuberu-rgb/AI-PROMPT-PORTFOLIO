## 2️⃣ Narrative Explanation  

Documenting **meeting minutes** is critical because:  
- Provides **a record of discussions and decisions** for accountability.  
- Ensures **action items are tracked and assigned** clearly.  
- Serves as a **reference for stakeholders not in attendance**.  
- Supports **project governance and transparency**.  

Without meeting minutes, **important decisions may be forgotten, responsibilities unclear, and follow-ups delayed**.
